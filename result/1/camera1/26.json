    "prompt": "Subject: The late 20s US woman (protagonist). Context: A cozy, sun-drenched interior (lived-in art studio with soft light streaming through sheer curtains, reflecting her artistic personality). Action: Laughing uninhibitedly—head tilting back slightly, eyes crinkling, mouth wide in a genuine smile—as he tells a story, her shoulders shaking gently with joy. Style: Soft, warm cinematic aesthetic mirroring her emotional openness. Camera Motion & Angle: Slow, gentle push-in from medium close-up to tight close-up, eye-level to maintain intimacy. Composition: Close-up framing on her face, focusing on crinkled eyes and wide smile to capture unguarded emotion. Ambiance: Warm golden light bathing the scene, natural soft lighting (golden hour), earthy color palette enhancing coziness.",
