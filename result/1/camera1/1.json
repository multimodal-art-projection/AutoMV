    "prompt": "Subject: The Woman (late 20s, artistic, introspective) and the city skyline. Context: City skyline at dawn, outdoors. Action: Standing still in the foreground, gazing at the skyline with a thoughtful, guarded expression; occasionally blinking, slightly shifting her weight, and slowly turning her head to follow the horizon. Style: Soft, cinematic, and introspective, reflecting the calm solitude of her emotional journey's beginning. Camera Motion & Angle: Slow dolly in from a wide to medium shot, eye level with a slight low angle to frame her against the skyline. Composition: Begins as a wide shot (including skyline and The Woman in foreground) transitioning to a medium shot (focusing on her upper body and face). Ambiance: Soft cool dawn light, calm and quiet mood, cool blue-gray tones with faint hints of warm pink on the horizon, emphasizing serene solitude.",
