    "prompt": "Subject: The Woman. Context: Cozy, sun-drenched art studio with lived-in details (easels, scattered paint tubes, half-finished sketches on walls). Action: Dips a wide brush into a palette of vivid blues and reds, applies bold, sweeping strokes to the canvas; pauses, tilts her head with a soft, growing smile, then leans in to add finer, dynamic details with a smaller brush. Style: Soft, warm, cinematic aesthetic. Camera Motion & Angle: Starts with extreme close-up (eye-level) on her hands, slow dolly back to medium shot (slightly low angle) capturing her and the canvas, then slow pan up to close-up (eye-level) on her face. Composition: Extreme close-up (hands), medium shot (full figure with canvas), close-up (face). Ambiance: Golden hour light streams through large windows, casting warm, golden tones; earthy studio palette (terracotta, soft browns) contrasts vividly with the bold paint on the canvas.",
