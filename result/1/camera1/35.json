    "prompt": "Subject: The Woman (late 20s, warm brown shoulder-length hair, artistic, introspective with a thoughtful guarded expression). Context: Sun-drenched art studio—cozy, lived-in with paint tubes, canvases, and soft golden light streaming through windows. Action: She steps slightly to her right,腾出空间 (making space), then extends her right hand gently forward in an inviting gesture, palm up, her guarded expression softening at the corners of her mouth. Style: Soft, warm cinematic aesthetic with golden natural lighting and warm earthy color palette. Camera Motion & Angle: Medium close-up, eye-level, subtle dolly in to focus on her face and gesturing hand. Composition: Framed to include her upper body, the gesturing hand, and blurred studio details in the background. Ambiance: Sun-drenched golden light, warm earthy tones (browns, golds, soft yellows), intimate and cozy atmosphere.",
