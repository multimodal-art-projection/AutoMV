    "prompt": "Subject: The Woman (late 20s US artist, protagonist). Context: Her apartment door, with cozy art-filled interior (paintings, sketchbooks) bathed in golden hour light. Action: Pausing at the door, glancing back at her old life inside with a guarded expression softening to thoughtful, then slowly turning to face the off-camera Man, making a decision. Style: Soft, warm cinematic aesthetic, intimate character focus (Western style). Camera Motion & Angle: Slow dolly in (eye level) to close-up as she softens, then gentle pan right to medium shot as she turns. Composition: Medium shot (door/interior) → close-up (face) → medium shot (turning to face him). Ambiance: Golden hour light, warm earthy tones, nostalgic yet hopeful mood.",
