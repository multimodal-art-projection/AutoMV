[{"shot_num": 1, "prompt": "Subject: The Woman. Context: Cozy art studio with lived-in details (paintbrushes, half-finished canvases, warm lamp). Action: Her hand (close-up) turns the wooden doorknob; door creaks open slowly, revealing a sliver of light; she pauses, then fully opens it, gaze lifting from the door to him, lips parting slightly with a nervous but hopeful expression. Style: Soft, warm cinematic aesthetic with intimate, character-focused cinematography. Composition: Close-up on her face (focus on eyes and trembling lips), transitioning to medium close-up as she looks toward him. Ambiance: Golden hour light streaming through studio windows, casting warm amber tones; earthy color palette (terracotta, soft brown, honeyed gold).", "camera_movement": "Slow push in from hand close-up to face, then gentle pan right", "shot_duration": 4.0}]
